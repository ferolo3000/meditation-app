# Meditapp

- In this time of crisis and uncertainty, meditation can help you reduce your stress levels and find much-needed inner peace. But given the current situation with Covid-19, even if the meditation apps only give you a break from the news and a chance to relax for ten minutes, they are worth it.

- Mmeditapp is a simple application built with pure Javascript and HTML5 video / audio element, which tells you when to inhale, hold and exhale.

- Miniproject combining skills from the **Brad Traversy** course **20+ Web Projects With Vanilla JavaScript** on **Udemy**.
